To start, we will rely on nmap service scanning (-sV) to capture the web server banner (-p80).

    kali@kali:~$ sudo nmap -p80 -sV 192.168.50.20

To take our enumeration further, we use service-specific Nmap NSE scripts, like http-enum, which
performs an initial fingerprinting of the web server.

    kali@kali:~$ sudo nmap -p80 --script=http-enum 192.168.50.20

Gobuster supports different enumeration modes, including fuzzing and dns, but for now, weâ€™ll only
rely on the dir mode, which enumerates files and directories. We need to specify the target IP
using the -u parameter and a wordlist with -w. The default running threads are 10; we can reduce
the amount of traffic by setting a lower number via the -t parameter.

    kali@kali:~$ gobuster dir -u 192.168.50.20 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -t5
